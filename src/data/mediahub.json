      "date": "16/06/2024",
      "description": "Malaysia's Nuren Group, which operates a digital platform for women in parenting, education and maternity wellness, is seeking to launch its initial public offering (IPO) on the National Stock Exchange of Australia. Set to debut at A$0.20 per share, the company is looking at a mid-July 2024 listing. The market for parenting tech is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by increasing awareness and demand for convenient, effective and personalised care solutions. The global parenting spending market, encompassing baby care products, childcare services, education technology, and parenting apps, is valued at several hundred billion dollars annually and is expected to continue growing significantly. Nuren aims to upgrade its technological offerings by integrating an AI-powered parenting chat into the Motherhood SuperApp. This presents a tremendous opportunity to capitalise on the expanding market and meet the evolving needs of modern families.",

Financial provider, spouse, teacher, chef, counsellor are all the other roles she manages in parallel. Based on Nuren Group’s 2023 research on Malaysians’ Digital Habits & Trends, women were found to be the bigger spenders compared to men, with 90% going on online sprees at least once a week. Another survey by Nuren Group, Finance Trends in Malaysia Survey Report 2024, revealed that 67% of women are taking charge when it comes to making financial decisions for themselves as well as their family.
