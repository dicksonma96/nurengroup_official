          <p>
            You should carefully consider these risks in light of your personal
            circumstances (including financial and tax issues) and seek
            professional guidance from your stockbroker, solicitor, accountant,
            financial adviser or other independent professional adviser before
            deciding whether to invest in Shares. There may also be risks in
            addition to these that should be considered, including in light of
            your personal circumstances.

            entirety before deciding whether or not to participate in the Offer.
            There are risks associated with an investment in Shares and some of
            the key risks are set out in Section 6 of the Prospectus. If you

          <h3>APPLICATIONS</h3>
          <p>
            Anyone who wants to acquire securities in the Company will need to
            carefully consider the Prospectus and complete an application form.
            The completed application form must be lodged, and the application
            monies paid, in accordance with the details set out in the
            Prospectus and application form. The Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)
            prohibits any person from passing onto another person an Application
            Form unless it is attached to or accompanied by a complete and
            unaltered version of the Prospectus.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p> There are 2 application modes available:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Option A: Apply online and pay electronically via &nbsp;
              <a
                href="https://apply.automic.com.au/NurenGroupLimited"
                target="_blank"
              >
                https://apply.automic.com.au/NurenGroupLimited
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Option B: Complete the physical application form attached to or
              accompanied by the Prospectus
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            Refer to the Prospectus for details of the applications process in
            relation to the Offer.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The Company reserves the right not to accept an application form
            from a person if it has reason to believe that when that person was
            given access to the electronic application form, it was not provided
            together with the Prospectus or any of those documents were
            incomplete or altered. If an application form is not completed
            correctly or if the accompanying payment is the wrong amount, the
            Company may, in its discretion, still treat the application form to
            be valid. The Company’s decision to treat an application as valid
            and how to construe, amend or complete the Application Form, will be
            final.
